In many ways, smart cities are similar to other types of cities and afflicted by similar concerns and problems, such as proper allocation of budget, maintenance of city services and keeping crime down. Hence in analyzing smart cities, there are many similar considerations that overlap with other types of cities. In this report, for the sake of constraining my scope, I will focus on the subset of considerations that are more pertinent, if not outright exclusive, to smart cities.

To begin, I will focus on three traits of smart cities that make them different from other cities - the focus on data collection, the use of expert technology and the extent of connectivity. These unique traits would also be important for contextualizing the archetypes that follow in subsequent sections.

## Data Collection

Smart cities typically rely on extensive data collection to support their applications. In his paper on the age of the smart city, Michael Batty (2017) proposes a cyclical schematic that illustrates the relationship between the actual city and its digital twin. In between the two there are smaller boxes with the words “Computers & Sensors” and “real-timed streaming BIG DATA” respectively. Indeed, the data collection effort is typically supported by both sensors and computers to collect “big data”, which may or may not be in real-time.

This data collection poses interesting problems, namely the contradiction with protecting citizens’ privacy and the question of ownership of the collected data.

## Sophisticated Technology

As hinted by “Computers & Sensors” in Batty’s paper, smart cities frequently rely on sophisticated technology, especially infocommunications and digital technologies.

In smart cities, there are additional concerns over the depth and opacity of technologies used. Specifically, the complexity acts as a barrier preventing the layperson from adequate understanding. This leads to asymmetric information, which in turn encourages excessive hype and exploitation. In addition, the rapid pace of technological development is another defining and important trait of smart cities. Specifically, this leads to problems such as outdated legacy systems and lagging legislative development.

## Extensive Connectivity

With extensive data collection via sensors, coupled with Internet and social media, everything and everyone is more connected in a smart city. While connectivity has always been a hallmark of great cities, smart city networks operate at an unprecedented speed and are incredibly intimate, reaching down to every individual.

Such networks permit the rapid spread of information. But networks are value-neutral and unaware of whether the information is good or bad, true or false. Fake news and disinformation spread just as quickly as truth and wisdom, perhaps even more quickly. Extensive connectivity also increases potential points of failure, such as critical chokepoints, whose failure could bring down the entire networks.

## An Example

Sensor *technology* has made it possible for Singapore to deploy low-cost air quality sensors around Singapore. These sensors *collect data* on air quality and upload the data to a central server that updates publicly available channels, which are made available to Singaporeans. A decrease in air quality propagates through this network to indirectly result in more people closing their windows and wearing masks, indirectly *connecting* the air to the people.
